                <section class="mb-5">
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Smartphones have snaked their way into almost every living moment of our
                        technologically-fueled lives. More people are buying smartphones, and the number of options is
                        also increasing. Choosing a smartphone from such an overwhelming list of options might get
                        confusing, so we made a guide that helps you pick the best smartphone for your needs.</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What to consider before buying a smartphone?</h2>
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Smartphone performance: Processor and RAM</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Your smartphone processor, also known as the chipset or the SoC, is the
                        component that is responsible for just about everything functioning on your smartphone. It is
                        essentially the brain of the system, and most of these processors also come equipped with AI
                        capabilities that essentially make your smartphone as ‘smart’ it is today.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A capable processor not only allows your device to function seamlessly but is
                        also capable of enhancing other factors. One example is image processing. Samsung phones, as an
                        example, comes in two variants - one hosting the Snapdragon chipset (the latest one being
                        Snapdragon 865+). In contrast, the other one employs Samsung’s in house Exynos processor (the
                        latest being Exynos 990). Some reviewers have explicitly stated that there is a tangible
                        difference in not just the processing power of the two variants, the Snapdragon being much
                        snappier, but also the image-processing abilities.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">So, when you choose your smartphone, it is integral to know what processor
                        you’re getting along with it since the performance directly correlates with it. Popular ones
                        include Snapdragon, Apple A13 Bionic, Exynos 990, and Kirin 990. Apple processors are known for
                        their raw computing power, and Snapdragon processors are the closest equivalent in the Android
                        realm. You also have lower-powered processors for mid-range and budget devices such as the
                        Snapdragon 730 and 730G, Snapdragon 675, MediaTek Helio G90T and G85, and more, that are
                        commonly found in lower-priced 2020 smartphones. If you’re on a budget and don’t mind
                        sacrificing some power to save money, consider buying phones with one of these processors since
                        they drive down costs quite a bit.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Coming to RAM, this refers to system memory that smartphones use to hold data
                        that active applications are using. A portion of your smart- phone’s RAM is always used up by
                        the operating system, to keep it run- ning. We’re not going to get into the nitty-gritty of RAM
                        usage in a phone since it involves explaining terms such as kernel-space which will end up
                        taking a lot of room in this article. Having sufficient RAM can allow you to have a larger
                        number of apps running in the background, which significantly affects your multitasking
                        experience. However, some smartphones are breaking all barriers and installing a whopping 12-16
                        GB of RAM in their smartphones. That’s definitely overkill for smartphones, especially if you
                        don’t plan on switching between 10-20 apps at the same time. If you’re a light smartphone user,
                        someone who only uses their phone for calls, texts, What- sApp and light browsing, you can
                        easily get away with 3-4 GB RAM. For power users, something around the ballpark of 6-8 GB is
                        perfectly fine.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Choice of operating system</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It boils down to two options - Android or iOS. The choice is actually more
                        complicated than you imagine since both operating systems have a sizable list of pros and cons.
                        If you’re someone who enjoys tinkering around with your device and customising it to your
                        heart’s content, you’re Team Android. If you like a simple, powerful OS which gets constant
                        software updates and is supported for a more extended period, you’re Team iOS. Nevertheless,
                        Android is also almost as powerful but not quite as simple, although the current Android version
                        has become much simpler to use than the days of Gingerbread. Just know that iOS, as an OS, is
                        quite limiting, in some cases. For instance, you cannot sideload apps from the internet if they
                        are not available on the App Store, the split-screen mode still isn’t a thing on iPhones (just
                        iPads), you cannot customise your home screen (although iOS 14 may include widgets), and you
                        definitely cannot use launchers to completely change the look of your phone. However, iOS comes
                        with a plethora of advantages as well, such as iMessage, FaceTime, regular software updates, and
                        the biggest of all, minimal bloatware, and no adware! We’re looking at you, Xiaomi!</p>


                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Prefered user interface</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You also have to keep in mind that numerous smartphones come with their own
                        skin or UI (user interface) smacked on top of Android. OnePlus has OxygenOS, a clean skin that
                        is quite close to stock Android, Samsung comes with One UI 2, which has improved by leaps and
                        bounds from its TouchWiz days, MIUI on Xiaomi phones, which is an ad-fest but is well-optimised,
                        ColorOS on Oppo and Realme smartphones, that is heavily inspired by iOS.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Remember to try and experience the UI before buying the device to see if it
                        works for you.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">A good display</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Smartphone display sizes seem to be ever-increasing and are continually pushing
                        the boundary of what we’d expect a smartphone display size to be. They’ve reached the ‘phablet’
                        realm with displays even reaching up to 6.9-inches!</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">However, in the age where content is being consumed increasingly on our pocket
                        devices (hard to call them that now), this may not be a bad thing. We suggest anything above 5.7
                        inches so you can really immerse yourself into games and media. As far as display types go, you
                        have LCD and AMOLED displays. AMOLED displays have variants such as OLED or Super AMOLED (in the
                        case of Sam- sung) and have better contrast and darker blacks. They also assist in saving
                        battery since they turn off all the black pixels on the phone to display ‘true black’.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Next, you also have various resolutions such as Full HD, Full HD+ Quad HD.
                        While QHD does provide crisper images, the difference between FHD and QHD is not too jarring,
                        especially to the untrained eye. You should also check the screen protection on your device.
                        Gorilla 5 and 6 are usually used in current-generation smartphones, and they provide reasonable
                        protection for your glass sandwiches. However, we still recommend a case strongly.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">The right amount of storage</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The current standard is 64GB on lower-end models and 128GB to 512GB on
                        flagships. With swift sharing apps and technologies, almost all of us import every single GB of
                        data from our previous phones to the new ones. So, adequate storage is essential. We recommend
                        that you do not go under 128GB since it will give you enough breathing room to keep your data as
                        well as download apps to your heart’s content. Also, keep an eye out for phones with expandable
                        memory storage.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Battery life that fits your daily requirements</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The golden standard of battery life in flagship smartphones is 6+ hours of
                        screen on time. Anything with higher capacities can mostly allow even heavy-users to power
                        through. Flagship phones, as well as some mid-range phones, can also reach 8-10 hours of screen
                        on time, which is brilliant. The goal is to get a phone that can at least pull through one whole
                        day of intensive usage. So, ensure to check battery tests online before purchasing a device.
                        Also, try and research if the phone you’re planning on buying has a decent power-saving mode.
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Camera quality that justifies the price</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        In 2020, multi-cameras are the norm and phones with just one rear camera are extremely rare now.
                        You usually get a primary lens which sports the highest MP count, a portrait lens, and a
                        wide-angle shooter. And then, you also have a few extras that some manufacturers add such as the
                        ToF (Time of Flight) sensor, macro lens, and colour filter lens. We, at the Digit Labs, are fans
                        of the wide-angle lens because of the magnitude of images you can now take on phones. Capturing
                        sprawling scenes is not a problem anymore! The portrait lens, when done well, can produce
                        spectacular bokeh shots too. However, if this trend just isn’t for you and the growing camera
                        bumps enrage you, it would be best to buy older phones with one primary lens or newer ones such
                        as the iPhone SE 2020. Also, don’t go MP hunting, higher megapixel-count doesn’t always mean
                        better images since the sensor size is much more integral to producing good photos.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        Smartphones have also been employing pixel-binning, which essentially turns four or more pixel
                        into one big pixel, that adds clarity and detail to the image. Also, for now, try to stray away
                        from the 108MP sensors since they’re pretty rough around the edges at the moment plagued with
                        image fringing and autofocus issues.
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Miscellaneous things to consider</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Wireless charging</li>
                        <li>Gaming Mode</li>
                        <li>Fingerprint sensor vs Face Unlock</li>
                        <li>Bluetooth version</li>
                        <li>IP Rating</li>
                        <li>Dual sim</li>
                        <li>Reverse wireless charging</li>
                        <li>Stereo speakers</li>
                        <li>NFC</li>
                        <li>Dual-band Wi-Fi</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What not to consider?</h2>
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Foldable designs</h4>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        While the design evolution is innovative and smart, it is simply too early to be completely
                        reliable. Our verdict? Hold off on buying foldable phones for a few years.
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">5G smartphones</h4>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        In a country like the US which is slowly but surely seeing widespread 5G integration (low band
                        or mmWave), sure, go for 5G phones to futureproof. However, 5G integration in India is still a
                        ways away, and the proper rollout is years away. So, it makes no sense paying more to purchase a
                        5G phone.
                    </p>
